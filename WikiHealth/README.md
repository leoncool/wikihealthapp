#Project

This project consists of an Android Application gathering data from sensors of mobile devices and uploads them to  WikiHealth API[1](http://wikihealth.bigdatapro.org/api/). It also uses GPS information and supports Zephyr HxM Heart-Rate Monitor.

Developed by Panayiotis Kritiotis as a part of his MSc Individual Project for the fulfillment of MSc Computing (Software Engineering).

#WikiHealth 
[website](http://wikihealth.bigdatapro.org/about/overview.php)

WikiHealth draws inspiration from existing platforms such as PatientsLikeMe (www.patientslikeme.com), which reports more than 175,000 active users and 1000 conditions. These figures indicate that people are very interested in using data-sharing social platforms for healthcare to communicate with other people who have common needs and learn more about themselves. 

WikiHealth will be a social platform for data-driven and context-specific discovery of citizen communities in the areas of health, fitness and well-being. WikiHealth will harness personalised and location-based information for health-related knowledge discovery available to individual users at a massive scale. WikiHealth is based on the concept of the wiki (or mass collaboration), according to which aggregated user-contributed content is collectively curated to produce unprecedented knowledge in a multi-perspective and socially engaging way. 

#Sensor Revolution

Mobile Phones are becoming increasingly successful in the area of health monitoring. They provide new ways to gather information, both manually and automatically, over wide areas. Many current phones have embedded a number of sensors such as microphone, camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, compass, proximity sensors, GPS and ambient light. The newer generation of professional medical sensors can easily connect to the smart phones and transfer the sensing results directly. This has brought a more efficient and convenient way of collecting information about persons health like blood pressure, oxygen saturation, blood glucose level, pulse, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalogram(EEG) and electrocardiography (EKG).
